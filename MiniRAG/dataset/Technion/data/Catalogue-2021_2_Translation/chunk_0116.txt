and may specify an agreement stating that
completion of these courses will serve as additional condition
for admission. The academic unit will determine the required
curriculum for the degree, and may add specific requirements
such as a requirement to repeat courses in which the grade
earned was less than 65, the extent of prior courses that need to
be completed, and the duration of studies. Students who return
to their studies after a prolonged break (over 3 years) will have
a plan determined for them regarding courses that need to be
completed in the scope of 10-25 credits.
