The basic unit of study is a semester-long course, i.e., a course
that takes place over the course of one semester. Students are
expected to complete the course, take an exam in the course and
receive a grade. Students who successfully pass a course, will
receive the allotted number of credits for that course. Students
who fail the course will not receive credit for the course. Prior to enrolling in a course, students must pass all the
prerequisites. Students who take a complementary course or a
course that is similar to one that they have already taken, will
have the credits they earned in the previous course cancelled
and then the credits and grade earned in the more recent course
will replace it.
