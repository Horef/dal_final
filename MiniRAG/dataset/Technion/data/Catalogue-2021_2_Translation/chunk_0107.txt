C. Students who are in poor academic standing will be invited
to their academic unit for counseling and guidance. The
academic unit will hold a discussion and, depending on the
severity of the student’s situation, will recommend – to the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies – conditions for continuing on
in the program (e.g., specifying a a mandatory course of
study/curriculum for one semester or one year, or other
requirements) or will recommend that the student’s studies be
terminated. During the course of the discussions, the student
will have the right to make his/her arguments.
