the Technion -113. The different placement levels are: Hebrew 3 or Exempt (which
does not grant any credit points). The “Hebrew 3” course will
be offered through the Pre-Academic Education Center
(preparatory). A passing grade in the “Hebrew 3” course will
grant 3 credit points (without a grade; P+). These credits are
considered to be part of the Technion general elective credits. Students who do not fulfill the Hebrew language requirements
by the end of their second semester at the Technion will be
considered to be a student in “poor academic standing” [see
Section 3.1.5.(B) (6)].
