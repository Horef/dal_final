with the Senate’s approval, the
required level to begin taking foundational courses (hereinafter,
the standard level). Based on this determination, a
recommended curriculum will be constructed. This will also
determine whether the specified level is a firm condition for
student admission or whether candidates with a sub-standard
level can be accepted, so long as they complete the missing
requirements. These courses will be prerequisites for the
relevant course in the curriculum. Hebrew studies are not
considered to be a prerequisite for starting one’s degree
program.
