will be able to apply for
enrollment in the integrated study track in the additional unit in
which they wish to study. Their application will be considered
only after they have accumulated at least 72 credits. The second unit in which the student wishes to study must
submit their recommendation to the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies for approval, on the basis of the student’s academic
performance, and the unit will determine the curriculum that the
student will need to complete which will include all mandatory
content for the additional track, with the exception of courses
that the student has already completed or will complete in the
track of his/her “home” faculty.
