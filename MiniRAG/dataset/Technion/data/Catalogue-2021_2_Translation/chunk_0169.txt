exams; publishing grades
7.1 The instructor in charge of the course is responsible for the
grading of the exams. Written exams and tests conducted
at the exam dates stipulated in Section 2.2.3 of the
Undergraduate Studies Regulations and Procedures will be
graded without seeing the name of the examinee on the
exam notebook. The instructor in charge of the course can
be assisted by assistant instructors, but the final grade must
be provided by him/her only. If there is no option to do so
logistically, then it will be done by another senior
instructor, as determined by the head of the unit.
