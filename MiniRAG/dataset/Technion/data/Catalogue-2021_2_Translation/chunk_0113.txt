will be sent to the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies for approval, who will be in charge of
making the final decision. Students who were in poor academic standing when their
studies were terminated or when they discontinued their studies
on their own accord at the Technion or any other institution,
will be able to apply to return to their study program two years
from the date at which their studies were discontinued. Students
who discontinued their studies on their own accord after only
one semester will be able to request a shorter break period,
however, this is subject to the approval of the academic unit.
