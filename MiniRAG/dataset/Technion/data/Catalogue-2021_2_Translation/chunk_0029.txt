progress at
a faster or slower pace than the average, in accordance with
their personal preferences and circumstances. Prior to each
semester, students (preferably with the guidance of an advisor)
will choose their own course schedule for the semester and will
be responsible for registering for all courses themselves. Once
the semester begins, students may still make changes to their
course schedule, up until the course change deadline. It is highly recommended that students who are required to
enroll in an English language course do so at the start of their
studies so that they can best utilize the professional literature in
English during their studies.
