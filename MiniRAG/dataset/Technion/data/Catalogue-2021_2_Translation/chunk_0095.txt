registration
Students shall enroll for courses for the winter and spring
semesters prior to the start of each semester. For courses that
are not project-based or laboratory-based, students may make
changes to their course list/schedule of classes within the first
two weeks of the semester. After the registration and course
change period ends (that is, from the start of the semester for
project-based and laboratory-based courses and from the start
of the 3rd week of the semester for all other courses), changes
can only be made in accordance with the guidelines specified in
advance by the unit responsible for the course and with the
approval of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies.
