Foundational courses include mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, English, and computer science. The syllabi for the foundational courses are determined by the units responsible for teaching the courses (mathematics, physics, biology, humanities, and computer science).
The courses that are offered to all units within the Technion are specified in Appendix C.
Mandatory courses, as well as foundational courses, are determined by the Academic Unitâ€™s Council.
