Establishing Tracks and
New Specializations
Definitions:
 Track – a program of study that leads to a separate degree.  Specialization – a program of study with a particular
concentration for which the student’s participation is
recorded only on the transcript. When an academic unit, with the approval of its council,
proposes to establish a new track that leads to a separate degree,
a proposal for approval shall be submitted to the Standing
Committee through the Academic Development Committee.
