If there is no standard form of instruction for a particular subject/course in one of the semesters, and if the nature of the subject lends itself to learning in a guided reading format, students can be instructed in this way after special approval is given by the head of the unit. Guided reading consists of:
holding regular meetings (at least once a week) with the instructor in charge, as well as submitting assignments as
required. The syllabus will be set in accordance with the points specified in Section 1.2.1.
