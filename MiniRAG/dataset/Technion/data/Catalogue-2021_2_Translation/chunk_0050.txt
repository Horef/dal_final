additional credit
Courses that contain a lot of similar material are defined as
courses without additional credit. That is, students who enroll
in two such courses will not receive any additional credits. Students will not be able to simultaneously enroll in two
courses that are specified as courses without additional credit. If a student has successfully passed a specific course and then
enrolls in a course without additional credit, the credits that
he/she earned in the first course will be revoked and the grade
earned in the second course will prevail.
