only if the head of the unit has recommended this and the Dean
of Undergraduate Studies has approved it. Students who are
enrolled in a course receive a university grade at the end of the
semester that reflects their performance in the course: A grade
of 55 or above reflects a passing grade and the student will
receive the allotted number of credits for the course. A grade
below 55 will reflect a failing grade and the student will not
receive any course credit. In both cases, the score will be
included in the calculation of the studentâ€™s weighted cumulative
average.
