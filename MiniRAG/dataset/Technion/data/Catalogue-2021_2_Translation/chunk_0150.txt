assignments,
quizzes, tours, etc., as well as the implications arising from
partial fulfillment of course requirements. The details of the
material that will be taught in the course will be included on the
course syllabus, as determined by the course instructor, in
addition to the material that will be taught in class. At the start
of the course, and at the latest within the first two weeks of the
semester, the instructor will determine the components of the
final grade, the weight of each component and how each
component will be weighed, and will inform the students of this
in writing or on the course website.
