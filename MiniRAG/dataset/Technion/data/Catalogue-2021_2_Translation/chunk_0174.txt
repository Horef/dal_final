he/she specified in
the appeal. Thus, the appeal may result in no change to the
grade, a higher score or a lower score. There is no right to
appeal a grade on an oral exam. 8.3 The course instructor must respond to appeals within a
reasonable amount of time (no later than one week before
the second exam date). An instructor who wishes to change
a grade, must submit a reasoned request to be approved by
the Dean of Undergraduate Studies. Any grade change
requests submitted to the Undergraduate Studies Secretary
long after the publication of the grade, must be reasoned
and detailed and must receive approval from the
undergraduate studies division in the unit.
