Foundational Studies
1. Foundational courses will be offered to all academic units at
the Technion. There will no course adjustments for academic units due to special arrangements. The topics in the foundational courses will be determined by the units responsible for them (mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, English, and computer science) in collaboration with committees that will be determined by the Senior Vice President for each of the units. These committees will condense the needs brought up by the units receiving the services, thus assisting in the construction of the foundational courses.
