semesters require the
approval of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies in addition to
meeting the admission requirements. Requests to return to oneâ€™s
studies for students who have completed three or more
semesters will be discussed by the academic unit to which the
student wants to be accepted. The academic unit may require
that the student take courses in an external setting during the
years in which they are on a break from their studies at the
Technion, and may specify an agreement stating that
completion of these courses will serve as additional condition
for admission.
