courses (as
indicated in Sections 1.1.4-1.1.6 below), as well as the number
of credits required for each category. The remaining credits required for completing the curriculum
will be fulfilled through general elective courses at the
Technion, as specified in Section 1.1.7 below. The curriculum submission procedure is specified in Appendix
A. 1.1.3 Tracks and specializations
One academic unit can be responsible for several curricula. When the different curricula of the unit lead to separate degrees,
they are defined as separate “tracks.” If the curriculum includes
a particular concentration, it is defined as a “specialization.”
The procedure for establishing new tracks and specializations
is specified in Appendix B.
