Tracks
The Technion offers bachelor’s degree programs
(undergraduate studies) as well as master’s and doctoral degree
programs (graduate studies). This catalogue is specific to
undergraduate studies and graduate studies. Students who apply
and are accepted to a bachelor’s degree program in one of the
admission tracks are thus considered to belong to one of the
academic units.
