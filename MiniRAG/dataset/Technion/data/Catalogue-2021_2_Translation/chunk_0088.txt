at a later time. In the case that the student chooses to repeat the course:
 The recorded grade will be “incomplete”.  The course will not be included in the course success rate
calculation.  The grade will be recorded in the semester in which the
requirements are completed. Students will be eligible to transfer the course grades they
received during the course of the semester in which they had
reserve duty, in accordance with the course requirements for the
semester to which they are transferring the grades; the instructor
shall help the student do so in a way that does not harm the
student nor the efforts he/she has invested during the semester
in which he/she had reserve duty.
