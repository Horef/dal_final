Foundational Studies
1. Foundational courses will be offered to all academic units at
the Technion. There will no course adjustments for academic
units due to special arrangements. The topics in the
foundational courses will be determined by the units
responsible for them (mathematics, physics, chemistry,
biology, English, and computer science) in collaboration with
committees that will be determined by the Senior Vice
President for each of the units. These committees will condense
the needs brought up by the units receiving the services, thus
assisting in the construction of the foundational courses.
2. The Faculty of Architecture and Town Planning, the Faculty
of Medicine, the Faculty of Biology, and the area of Economics
and Management in the Faculty of Industrial Engineering and
Management will be exceptions. Committees shall be
