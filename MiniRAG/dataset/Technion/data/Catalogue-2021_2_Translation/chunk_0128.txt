for the purposes of this section. The list of study routes will be
published on the Undergraduate Studies website. The Dean of Undergraduate Studies will determine and publish,
prior to the graduation ceremony held each year, the numerical
thresholds for the academic distinction of summa cum laude
and cum laude for each study route for the year leading up to
the ceremony in the following year. The thresholds for the
following year will be determined on the basis of the academic
performance of graduates in that study route in the previous
semester.
