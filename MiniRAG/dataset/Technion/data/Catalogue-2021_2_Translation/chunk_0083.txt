allow students to complete the course
material and all course requirements in the semester in which
they are enrolled. The Senate asks all bodies that deal with this
matter to do everything in their power so that the disruption is
minimized. The purpose of this regulation is to try and
minimize the harm to studentsâ€™ studies among those who are
serving in the reserves. Students who serve in the reserves during the semester will be
entitled to solutions that will minimize any harm to their
studies, the grades that they deserve or the duration of their
studies.
