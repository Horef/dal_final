Prior to beginning one’s studies at the Technion, applicants
must pass an English placement exam (either via the
psychometric test or the AMIR test). Applicants who do not
have a Bagrut certificate must pass a Hebrew placement exam.
Some applicants must also take a placement exam in Physics
and Chemistry.
English placement exam
Taking an English placement exam is mandatory for anyone
who has been accepted to the Technion; this requirement can be
met either with the “English” portion of the psychometric test
or the “AMIR” test. A minimum level of knowledge in English
is necessary in order to begin one’s studies at the Technion. The
different placement levels are: Advanced English A, Advanced
Technical English B, or Exempt.
Physics placement exam
The Physics placement exam consists of two parts: mechanics
and electricity. Passing the mechanics portion of the exam is a
prerequisite for physics-mechanics courses and passing the
electricity portion of the exam is a prerequisite for physics-
electricity courses.
Exemption from the physics placement exam will be granted in
the following circumstances: Students who have been accepted
to a program in Architecture, Landscape Architecture,
Economics, Education in Science and Technology (in the
biology, mathematics, or computer science track), or Medicine;
students who have earned at least 4 units of study in physics on
the Bagrut and received a grade of 70 or above. Exemption from
the mechanics portion of the exam will be granted for students
who were enrolled in the technological track for practical
engineers, specializing in mechanics or agricultural mechanics,
and who have received a grade of 70 or above on the external
gical track for practical
engineers, specializing in mechanics or agricultural mechanics,
and who have received a grade of 70 or above on the external
