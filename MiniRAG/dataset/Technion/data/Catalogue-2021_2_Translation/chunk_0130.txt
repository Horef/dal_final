by the exam supervisors while in the exam room. The exam supervisor may, at his/her discretion, move a student to another seat at any time. Upon entering the exam rooms, students will leave their belongings at the entrance (including electronic means of communication which must be turned off). They will only come into the exam room with the material that is permitted for the exam, will sit in the place designated for them by the supervisor and will avoid having any conversations.
