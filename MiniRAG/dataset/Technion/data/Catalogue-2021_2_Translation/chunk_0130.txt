that this GPA is above the threshold set for the summa cum
laude distinction in his/her study route. The criterion for honors
is the student’s GPA for the list of courses for their degree,
which must be 84 or above, provided that this GPA is above the
threshold set for the cum laude distinction in his/her study route
(and the student is not eligible to receive a degree with summa
cum laude). This is in effect from the 2007-2008 class year,
June 2008 graduation ceremony. 3.2.5 Graduation dates
Each student’s date of graduation is determined on the basis of
the date on which the last grade was received, and will be set
for the first of the month following that date.
