the Technion,
students will be able to transfer if their admission data meet the
admission threshold set by the unit. The transfer will be
conditional on their academic standing after they have fulfilled
the requirements of the semester in which the application is
submitted (a GPA of at least 65, a course success rate of at least
66%). Students who have completed at least two semesters at the
Technion and have taken courses from the standard course
basket (as approved by the Senate on May 23, 1993) and whose
performance ranks at the top 25% of the corresponding group
of students within the study track to which they wish to transfer,
will be admitted to their desired study track.
