weeks during which the first exam dates (Moed A) and then the
second exam dates (Moed B) for all courses will be held. During
the period of time designated for exams, no exams will be held
for courses worth fewer than 1.5 credits. In these courses,
grades will be determined on the basis of tests and/or exams that
were held during the course of the semester. There is no option
to hold these final exams earlier in the semester, and definitely
not during the last week of the semester.
