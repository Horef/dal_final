framework of the academic reserve (hereinafter: reserve duty)
during the course of the semester and/or the exam period. The
Senate calls on the heads of the academic units and lecturers to
alleviate the distress of those serving in the reserves and
particularly to those serving for long periods of time during the
semester (including the exam period). The academic units must
make every effort to allow students to complete the course
material and all course requirements in the semester in which
they are enrolled.
