credit; one lab hour = 1/3 credit (except for projects). The credit
amount should be rounded to the nearest half point. Credits can
be increased for increased workloads. However, the number of
credits cannot be less than the number determined by the above
guide. Currently, courses in the Humanities and Arts that
include 2 hours of lecture can be worth 1.5 credits. Course
credits are determined according to the hours of work required
of the student in practice. In general, 50-60 hours of work per
week is equivalent to 20 credits.
