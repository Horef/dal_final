in ascending order (by course number), as well as a list
of all courses classified as being beyond the requirements. If a
student has repeated a course, only the most recent time that the
course was taken will appear on the diploma (any courses that
were not completed will not appear on the lists, but if the course
was taken previously and the student received a grade, that
grade is valid and will appear on the lists). Appendix A: Procedure for Submitting a
Curriculum
This procedure refers to the preparation of curricula, which are
submitted by the council of the academic units to the Standing
Committee for Undergraduate and Graduate Studies, via the
Central Committee.
