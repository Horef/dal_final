be distributed
to students. A copy of the official syllabus will be distributed to
each student enrolled in the course. Each academic unit must
review and, if necessary, update the curriculum at least once
every three years. 1.2.2 Determining the number of credits per course
This guide is to be used to determine the number of credits per
course: one lecture hour = 1 credit; one practicum hour = Â½
credit; one lab hour = 1/3 credit (except for projects). The credit
amount should be rounded to the nearest half point.
