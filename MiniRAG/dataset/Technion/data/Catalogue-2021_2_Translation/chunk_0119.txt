group
of students within the study track to which they wish to transfer,
will be admitted to their desired study track. Applications from students who have completed at least two
semesters at the Technion but whose performance is not in the
top 25%, or who have not taken courses from the relevant
course basket, as well as applications from students who have
not yet completed two semesters at the Technion and who are
in poor academic standing, will be forwarded on to the unit. The
unit will submit a recommendation to the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies regarding their admission on the basis
of their academic performance at the Technion and their initial
admission data.
