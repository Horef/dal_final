Absence from an exam
Students are entitled to not take an exam during the exam period
and to receive an alternative solution, such as taking the exam
at a different date, if one of the following conditions are met:
 Reserve service on the day of the exam (except for
conferences/interviews in which one can choose the date of
participation);
 Reserve service of at least three days per week prior to the
exam date;
 Reserve service of at least 10 consecutive days or 14 days in
total during the semester, up until the start of the exam period;
 Reserve service of at least 10 days in total during the exam
period.
If the course instructor sets another date for the exam as a
solution, the date of the alternative exam shall be no later than
during the exam
period.
If the course instructor sets another date for the exam as a
solution, the date of the alternative exam shall be no later than
date (Moed B). The faculties are responsible for setting the date
of the exam for reservists while taking into account the tests and
exam dates of other courses in the current semester.
The above instructions also apply to valid tests.
In the case of a “protective” exam, the solution offered will be
the responsibility of, and at the discretion of, the lecturer, and
will be implemented in such a way that does not harm the
student.
Instead of a taking the exam on the alternative date, students
will be able to cancel their course registration or can choose to
repeat the course at a later time.
