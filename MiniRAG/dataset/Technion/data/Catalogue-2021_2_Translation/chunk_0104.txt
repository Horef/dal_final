who excel in their studies will be awarded the “Dean’s
Excellence Award” or the “President’s Excellence Award” and
receive a monetary prize.
Students who fail will have their
circumstances discussed by the academic unit which will
consider whether to terminate their studies and then will pass
on their recommendation to the Dean of Undergraduate Studies;
this may or may not lead to a discontinuation of their studies.
