exception of courses
that the student has already completed or will complete in the
track of his/her “home” faculty. The minimum credit points that
the student must accumulate in both tracks will be 0.75 of the
total points that must be accumulated in each track. For example, if a student is studying in a track at the Technion
in which 160 points must be accumulated, and wants to study
for another degree in a track in which 120 points must be
accumulated, then in total, he/she must accumulate at least 210
points, and therefore, the remaining credits that the student must
complete will consist of at least 50 points.
