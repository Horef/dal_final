credit. In both cases, the score will be
included in the calculation of the studentâ€™s weighted cumulative
average. There are a small number of courses in which the
grading system is binary --pass/fail. A passing grade entitles
the student to credits whereas a failing grade does not grant the
student any credits. A binary grade does not influence the
cumulative average. A student who is registered for a course but
does not fulfill one of the requirements of the course, such as a
final exam or submission of a project, might not receive a final
grade, as per the discretion of the lecturer.
