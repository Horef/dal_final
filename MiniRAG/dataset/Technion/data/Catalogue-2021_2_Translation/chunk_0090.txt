an extension for at least the number of days that they were in

The extension will also apply to the studentsâ€™ partners on a
group assignment. For students who missed the submission deadline of a
significant number of assignments in the course due to reserve
duty of 14 days or longer, the instructor will determine an
alternative solution for submitting the assignments.
