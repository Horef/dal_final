as a “specialization.”
The procedure for establishing new tracks and specializations
is specified in Appendix B. 1.1.4 Foundational courses
Foundational courses include mathematics, physics, chemistry,
biology, English, and computer science. The syllabi for the
foundational courses are determined by the units responsible for
teaching the courses (mathematics, physics, biology,
humanities, and computer science). The courses that are offered to all units within the Technion are
specified in Appendix C.
