and if
necessary, also on entrance exams and language proficiency
tests (for example, the AMIR test or the YAEL test). Additional
admission routes are periodically published on the Registration
website. Applicants who have a different type of matriculation
certificate are admitted to the Technion on the basis of technical
exams in mathematics, physics, Hebrew, English, and their
psychometric exam scores. All applicants to the Faculty of
Architecture and Town Planning must also take an entrance
exam in landscape architecture.
