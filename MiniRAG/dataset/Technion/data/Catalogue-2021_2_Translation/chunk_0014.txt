focused on various issues including the academic calendar
(shortening the semester to 13 weeks, determining the dates of
Hannukah vacation, and a shortened exam period); the lack of
readiness among students who are accepted to the Technion
(completing mandatory courses prior to the start of their studies,
exam period); the lack of
readiness among students who are accepted to the Technion
