with the
approval of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies, and approval
will only be provided in exceptional cases. Applicants who are
accepted for the winter semester may start their studies during
the previous summer semester. Semesters
Studies take place across two semesters: the winter semester
(starts each year in October) and spring semester (starts each
year in March). Each semester is 13 weeks, not including
holidays and vacations. The summer semester lasts about 7
weeks. In the summer semester, which is an official semester, a
limited number of courses are taught; this allows students to
close any gaps that they may have in their studies or to progress
at a faster pace.
