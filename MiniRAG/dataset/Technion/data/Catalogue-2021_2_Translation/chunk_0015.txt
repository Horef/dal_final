are taught; this allows students to
close any gaps that they may have in their studies or to progress
at a faster pace. Due to the short time span of the semester, the
number of weekly teaching hours for each course is double that
of a regular semester. It is possible to start oneâ€™s studies in any
semester (including the summer semester), except for units in
which admission occurs only once a year. Semester-long courses
The basic unit of study is a semester-long course, i.e., a course
that takes place over the course of one semester.
