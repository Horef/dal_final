semester will be able to request a shorter break period,
however, this is subject to the approval of the academic unit. Admission for students whose studies have been terminated or
who discontinued their studies on their own accord after
completing only one semester will be based on the standard
admission requirements of the unit to which the student wants
to be accepted. Requests to return to oneâ€™s studies among
students who have completed at least two semesters require the
approval of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies in addition to
meeting the admission requirements.
