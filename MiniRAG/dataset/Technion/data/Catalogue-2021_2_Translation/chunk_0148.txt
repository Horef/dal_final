of this procedure is to establish rules for exams and

assessment
For each course that is offered by more than one instructor, the
head of the unit offering the course will appoint an instructor
who will be responsible for that particular course. In addition to
the instructorâ€™s role of being responsible for the course, this
instructor will also be responsible for the exam, grades, and
grade appeals in the course; will ensure that the exam is uniform
across all instructors; and will ensure that the assessment
method is identical for all students enrolled in the course.
