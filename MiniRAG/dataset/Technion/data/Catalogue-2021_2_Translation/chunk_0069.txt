to achieve this goal; however, the instructor is not obligated to

To the extent that the course is taught by several different
instructors at the same time, the head instructor will be
responsible for ensuring that the exam is standardized across
instructors, and that the method of evaluation is identical. In
addition, the head instructor will be the one to approve the
grades given to students. 2.2.3 Exam dates
At the end of each semester, there will be a period of three
weeks during which the first exam dates (Moed A) and then the
second exam dates (Moed B) for all courses will be held.
