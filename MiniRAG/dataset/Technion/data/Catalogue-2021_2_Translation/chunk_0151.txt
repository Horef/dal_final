component will be weighed, and will inform the students of this
in writing or on the course website. If exams will be held in the
course, the instructor must inform the students in advance what
type of exams will be included. The instructor of the course
cannot change the components of the final grade during the
semester, except in exceptional circumstances and with the
approval of the head of the academic unit. The instructor
appointed to be responsible for the course will also be
responsible for all that is stated in this section (see point 2
above).
