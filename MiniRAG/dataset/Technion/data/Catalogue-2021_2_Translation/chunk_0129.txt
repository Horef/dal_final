will be determined on the basis of the academic
performance of graduates in that study route in the previous
semester. The thresholds will be set in such a way that, in each
study route, approximately 3% of students will graduate summa
cum laude and approximately 15% of students will graduate
cum laude (including those who graduate summa cum laude). The determination of each graduate’s level of distinction will
be made upon confirmation of graduation. The criterion for distinction is the student’s GPA for the list of
courses for their degree, which must be 91 or above, provided
that this GPA is above the threshold set for the summa cum
laude distinction in his/her study route.
