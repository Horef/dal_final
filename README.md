Our project is based on the following two github repositories:
- [MiniRAG](https://github.com/HKUDS/MiniRAG)
- [RAGAS](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas)

TODO:
- [ ] Fix table reading (or at least parse a clear semester - course - number of points relations)
- [ ] Create a data splitter which would produce relevant data chunks from a txt document (i.e., division at each sub-sub-section, or sub-section, etc.)
- [ ] Maybe (?) add external data source to find course prerequisites, etc..
- [ ] Figure out how to use MiniRAG
